                <h4>Fast Answers â€“ Save Time</h4>
                <p>With Natural Language Processing, bots can understand both written and verbal requests across
                    different locations such as Slack, Skype, Google Assistant, or even on your website. They can be
                    used to answer questions from your team or your client. You can seek help from bots wherever and
                    whenever you want.</p>

                <h4>Increase Sales</h4>
                <p>If you have an ecommerce site, your bot can also suggest or remember products that your client has
                    already searched for. It can also offer a special code as a strategy to reduce your abandonment rate
                    and increase sales.</p>

                <h4>Easy Integration with Common Apps or Enterprise Services</h4>
                <p>More and more people are using instant messaging over browsing websites and social media profiles. In
                    addition, people tend to keep using the main apps they already have (such as Facebook, Messenger,
                    WhatsApp, Skype, etc) to get customer service. If you want a chatbot for your website, you could
                    simply integrate your system into common and existing apps.</p>

                <h4>Assistance Available 24/7 for your clients</h4>
                <p>Many businesses have 24-hour customer support, but if you have certain peak hours, a customer will
                    still have to wait to get in touch with an agent that can help them. Bots don't have unexpected
                    meetings, they don't get tired or sick and will continue providing assistance to your clients or
                    your team.</p>

                <h4>Efficiency, Automated</h4>
                <p>Automation is one of the most significant key factors in enhancing work efficiency. With the help of
                    bots, you can automate mundane tasks and have them enter data for you.</p>
